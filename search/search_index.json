This lab demonstration illustrates catastrophic failures that occur faster than any human can react. When an arc flash strikes\u2014a worker has no chance of getting out of the way!</p>    Your browser does not support the video tag.  <p>Arc flash events can reach temperatures of 20,000\u00b0C \u2014that is nearly four times hotter than the surface of the Sun! These extreme temperatures cause disabling second and third degree burns within milliseconds of exposure. The event creates an arc blast pressure wave reaching thousands of pounds per square inch, powerful enough to knock workers off ladders, rupture eardrums, or collapse lungs. The blast blows equipment apart and propels molten metal shrapnel with enough force to completely penetrate through a worker's body.</p> <p>When viewing these demonstrations, observe the explosive force, blinding light, molten metal spray, and instantaneous destruction of equipment. An unprotected worker could be severely injured or killed by any of these effects. This is why proper PPE and preventative safety procedures are absolutely NON NEGOTIABLE! Following strict safety protocols is critical when we work with high energy electrical systems.</p> <p>REMEMBER: Any attempts to disable or circumvent any electrical safety devices or LOTO equipment will be grounds for your immediate dis-honorable termination and dismissal.</p> <p>The critical factor to consider is the incident energy\u2014this is the energy from the blast that directly impacts you. Arc energy originates from a single point, and the farther you are from this point, the less incident energy your body will be exposed to.</p> <p>Terraform's AC grid, photovoltaic arrays, and battery systems all have different incident energies. Based on calculations, Class 1 PPE is sufficient for our systems.

Proper clearances must be maintained.</p> <p>Effects: Sustained electrical arcs\u2014such as those from high-current industrial faults or welding\u2014can easily reach 3000 \u00b0C, which is already hot enough to melt steel and vaporize many metals.

It does not take very much current to cause real damage. Low frequency AC (such as 60Hz) is more dangerous than DC due to its tendency to prevent the person in shock from letting go.</p> <p>Current Thresholds:</p> <ul> <li>AC current of concern: &gt;15mA</li> <li>DC current of concern: &gt;100mA</li> </ul> <p>Example: Someone touches one phase of a 3-phase 480V circuit due to a nick in the cable while their feet are on concrete.

Your resistance is drastically lower if your skin is wet or has any type of cut or scrape.</p> <p>Based on IEC 60479-1</p>      This diagram illustrates the electrical impedance pathways through the human body, critical for understanding electric shock risks and physiological effects. The figure shows resistance values for the 5th percentile of the population\u2014those with the lowest body impedance who face the highest risk from electrical contact.          Typical body impedance ranges from 1000-2000\u03a9 for dry skin contact, but can drop below 500\u03a9 with wet or broken skin. The hand-to-foot path is particularly dangerous as it directs current through the torso and potentially the heart. Even relatively low voltages (50V+) can drive lethal currents of 50-100mA through these low-resistance paths, causing ventricular fibrillation.          The segmented resistance values demonstrate how factors like moisture, skin integrity, contact pressure, and contact area dramatically affect total body impedance. Sweaty hands, cuts, or large contact areas can reduce skin resistance from thousands of ohms to mere hundreds.          These values explain why electrical safety standards set conservative voltage thresholds (typically 50V AC, 120V DC) and why even household voltages (120/240V) must be treated as potentially lethal\u2014under worst-case conditions, the human body presents minimal resistance to current flow through vital organs.    <p></p>"},{"location":"procedures/hazard-identification/#electrical-fire","title":"Electrical Fire","text":"<p>Cause: Electrical systems can get dangerously hot without needing to arc:</p> <ul> <li>Moderate to high currents can make undersized conductors hot enough to burn   you or catch fire</li> <li>High current systems see increased fire risk with poor busbar-to-busbar   torques or corrosion on contact faces</li> </ul> <p>Effects:</p> <ul> <li>Burns to personnel</li> <li>Risk of igniting other flammable materials in the area</li> </ul> <p>Common Causes:</p> <ul> <li>Poor electrical connections</li> <li>Undersized wires for the current load</li> </ul> <p></p> This exemplifies what happens when more current is drawn through a conductor than it is rated for.
